I have created the main GUI layout with button options and user text input, and I am currently working on the pop-up dialog windows for each button in the left panel. I have not started making the tables to display the processed data. 

Future Work: 
Add charts that display a bar graph of milk weight by farm and a method that adds a pie chart to the reports that displays the milk weight percentage for each farm.

Bugs:
Table that should show data is not currently showing the individual data
Unable to run Date Range Reports
